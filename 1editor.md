# The Editor (E)

The Editor is the only member of the team focused on 'the final story'. It is their role to identify what exactly the story is that the team is pursuing, and plan how the resources of the team should be best employed in pursuing that. It will help if they form the story as a hypothesis to be tested by the team gathering evidence - following [Mark Lee Hunter's story based inquiry method](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001930/193078e.pdf) (PDF). 

Qualities needed and developed by the editor include:

* A nose for a story

* Project management skills

* People management skills - a good listener and decisive communicator

* Newswriting - the ability to communicate a story effectively

The rest of the team will be looking to you for guidance and support. This means you should have a good understanding of how each person's role fits into the bigger picture of the investigation - and when you need to help.

There's more useful guidance on the personal skills needed in [this post on 5 tips for new editors](http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/leadership-management/204689/find-your-resilience-5-tips-for-new-editors/).

## What ingredients will your investigation need?

A good way to do this is to sketch out what your final story might look like, and make a list of the ingredients. Here's an example:

* Introduction: case study of a student working in the sex industry

* Context: how many others are there? Does anyone know - and if not why not?

* Background: why is this happening? Does anyone know - and on what basis?

* Action: what is being done about it?

* Reaction: what do the people affected think about that?

* Next steps: what is happening next?

* Ending: perhaps the person we started with, or the next step, or an expert or strong quote.

This will be made easier if you **read as many examples of longform journalism that you can get your hands on**. Mark Lee Hunter's free ebook the [Global Investigative Journalism Casebook](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002176/217636e.pdf) contains dozens of great examples. 

## Who will gather each ingredient?

With those ingredients listed, you and your team can then identify ways of getting those, like so:

* *Case study of a student working in the sex industry* - **community manager** can try to find a number of sources by talking to various people who might come into contact with such a person: fellow students; student welfare workers; social workers; charities looking at the issue; academic researchers, campaigners etc. As they do so, they can write up stories based on their interviews. The **multimedia journalist** might conduct one or more interviews on video or audio, and write other articles out of the research done for those.

* *How many others are there? Does anyone know - and if not why not?* - **data journalist** can look for statistics from government agencies (local and national), charities and researchers. Talk to people at those agencies to find out what exists, and if not why not. There will be various stories to write about the results of each stage.

* *Background: why is this happening? Does anyone know - and on what basis?* - **network journalist** can gather previous reports on the same issue, talk to key people in the field named in those reports. The **multimedia journalist** might conduct an interview on video or audio, and write other articles out of the research done for those.

* *What is being done about it?* - **network journalist** can find out, talk to key people in the field. 

* *What do the people affected think about that?* **community manager** can talk to members of the different communities affected, and/or host a live Q&A. The **multimedia journalist** might conduct an interview on video or audio, and write other articles out of the research done for those.

* *What is happening next?* - **network journalist** can find out, talk to key people in the field. 

* *Ending* - this could come from any of the ingredients above, most likely one of the interviews.

Those are the priorities of your investigation. You might want to think about which pieces will need to be started first. For example, some sources will be harder to find than others, or will take longer to respond. Remember that *finding* can happen well before *interviewing*, so you can never start too early.

Likewise, some processes will take longer. The data journalist might need to submit a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. This is likely to take at least four weeks before a  response, so needs to be sent early on.

Help your team prioritise and organise their action in this way. Then:

* Know what content each member is producing that week. Suggest other content if it is more important.

* Provide guidance on the 'angle' the story might take. For example, if they're doing an interview, 'Q&A with Joe Bloggs' is not an angle - the angle should be the most newsworthy or surprising thing they tell you.

* Suggest connections, leads, and sources - should the multimedia journalist record the interview? Does the community manager have a good contact on that? Has the network journalist just found something which they might want to follow up, mention or incorporate?

* Identify anything that's missing, or where extra work is needed. This is where you come in.

## But what do I do?

The final story is *not* the only content the editor produces. You should also be producing content every week. However, unlike the other roles, this can vary based on the demands of that final story.

If your investigation needs more background research, then you might perform a 'second network journalist' role. If it needs more data then you might be a 'second data journalist'. If that data needs mapping and the multimedia journalist has enough to do, your role might be to do that. If the investigation relies on intense communication with a community, that might be your role.

And this might change from week to week. 

In short, your role is to make sure that all the ingredients will be there at the end of the investigation - and to perform whatever role(s) are needed to do that.

Is this extra work? Probably. Is it worth it? Definitely. That's what makes you the editor: do it well and you'll have a great set of skills to talk about at interviews.

## How to do it

As editor it is important that you know your field and what's happening in that. This background knowledge and topical awareness is what allows you to say "That's newsworthy because..." or "Did you know about this too..?"

To build that, here's a guide on [7 ways to follow a field you want to investigate](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/7-ways-to-follow-a-field-you-want-to-investig) from the Help Me Investigate blog. This is also part of the network journalist section, but it's useful to you as editor too.

## 7 ways to follow a field you want to investigate

Here's a part by part guide to how you can follow different 'streams' of information as a journalist to understand what's going on in a particular field, and how they can inform your real-world digging. Most of them involve using an RSS reader like Google Reader to follow feeds to keep in touch with developments.

## 1. Prepackaged news

While much is made of the 'exclusive' in journalism, and students will be harangued for recycling work done by other journalists, the truth is that the first thing most journalists do every day is check out their competitors, and get a feel for the current news agenda. A journalist has to balance being 'on top' of developments that others are covering ("Why don't we have something on this story?"), while also reporting information that others don't have.

[**Journalisted**](http://journalisted.com/) provides feeds for most national journalists and many regional ones too. Sadly there's no way (that I know of) to browse by specialist field, However you can use a search like [**"health correspondent" site:journalisted.com**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=%22health+correspondent%22+site%3Ajournalisted.com) to get a good idea.

This will omit those whose bios don't describe their specialism, however. So an alternative tack is to pick a particular story which you would assume most reporters in a particular field will have covered, and search for mentions of that on Journalisted.

With most journalists now on Twitter, it's also worth looking for lists of correspondents or departments (e.g. [**@GdnHealthcare**](http://twitter.com/GdnHealthcare)). You can [**search Twitter bios on FollowerWonk**](http://followerwonk.com/), there are Twitter list directories on [**Twibes**](http://www.twibes.com/),[**Listorious**](http://listorious.com/), and [**other sites**](http://www.jasonbartholme.com/21-twitter-directories-and-follower-finders-to-expand-your-twittersphere/), or you can simply [**search Google for the type of Twitter list you're after**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=twitter+list+directory+health#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=twitter+list+health&oq=twitter+list+health&aq=f&aqi=g-v4&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=137148l137148l0l137498l1l1l0l0l0l0l128l128l0.1l1l0&gs_l=serp.3..0i15l4.137148l137148l0l137499l1l1l0l0l0l0l128l128l0j1l1l0&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.).

Following specialist journalists and departments will only tell you what's already being reported, however. You'll need to follow a lot more feeds to move up the news food chain.

## 2. Corridors of power

If something is important, chances are it will end up being raised or discussed around Parliament at some point. People may write to their local MP just as readily as a local journalist, and organisations may raise issues as part of a submission to a [**select committee**](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/select/) that they wouldn't otherwise air publicly.

This applies whether you're covering an obviously political field, like health, or something less clearly political, such as sport or the arts -- both of which receive government funding and are subject to regulations and processes laid down by politicians and civil servants.

It's important, then, to keep on top of what's being discussed in the corridors of power -- whether that is Prime Minister's Questions, Written Answers, select committees, or one of the many other discussions and meetings that take place in Westminster and elsewhere.

[**TheyWorkForYou**](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/) is a good first port of call on this front, as it provides email and RSS alerts for everything recorded in Parliament (for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland you should also follow your national parliament or assembly). Here are some suggestions:

* Identify key terms, places, people and organisations in your field and subscribe to searches for those. The more specific the better: "[**apprenticeships**](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?s=apprenticeships)" rather than "training", for example.

* Know who the key ministers are in your field and follow what they say. For example, Michael Gove may be the Secretary of State for Education, but universities come under [**BIS**](http://www.bis.gov.uk/) (the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills), and [**the universities minister is David Willetts**](http://www.bis.gov.uk/ministers/david-willetts). The shadow universities minister is Shabana Mahmood ([**more on shadow ministers here**](http://www.labour.org.uk/shadow-cabinet)). The ministers for education in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are [**John O'Dowd**](http://www.deni.gov.uk/index/85-about-the-dept/about-dept-education-structure-pg/41-about-the-department-structure-and-functions-education-minister-pg.htm), [**Michael Russell**](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/14944/Scottish-Cabinet/michaelrussellmsp) and [**Leighton Andrews**](http://wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetm/leightonandrews?lang=en)respectively, and so on.

* There may also be members of the House of Lords with particular professional backgrounds or interests who are relevant -- try a [**search limited to the Lords biographies pages**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=professor+site%3Awww.parliament.uk%2Fbiographies%2Flords%2F)(site:www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/).

* Look for [**ongoing and upcoming consultations**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=consultations+site%3Agov.uk). These invite people to submit their thoughts on a particular area or issue, and can lead you to people (experts in your field, people with interesting experiences), information (reports, statistics and research) and leads (problems, conflicts, unsupported claims, etc.) Again, there will be separate consultations for devolved nations.

Each government department has a list of ongoing and upcoming consultations, and you can normally find links to the formal submissions. If there is a feed, subscribe. If not, [**make one**](http://www.feedage.com/html2rss/).

There are also other mailing lists you should look out for and follow. For example, [**Info4local**](http://www.info4local.gov.uk/) is particularly useful, allowing you to select from a range of locations, bodies and topics.

For more on finding information from parliamentary sources, see this video of Jon Walker, a Westminster correspondent for the Birmingham Post & Mail:

## 3. Events

Events provide a number of useful pieces of information to the network journalist. Firstly, they provide an indication of talking points within a particular field, and their perceived importance: what is the keynote about? The panel discussions? If attendees choose threads of discussion, or elect to go to one over another, what do they choose?

Secondly, they provide a list of potential contacts: the speakers, certainly, but also those attending if the list is published on an Eventbrite page, for example. Even if the list is not published, you can make a note to search for "going to X" on social networks, and to look for mentions while the event is taking place (which will also direct you to people within the field who are not attending but who are talking about the event anyway).

Obviously you want to attend the event yourself: making contacts in person is invariably more effective than online approaches, and just listening to the chatter between people can give you insights you won't otherwise get.

It also makes it easier to find people talking about the location 'near you' using social media apps that incorporate search by location (e.g. [**Osfoora**](http://www.osfoora.com/) or[**Flickr's map**](http://www.flickr.com/map/)). 

If that's not possible you can still pick up a lot of information from following the event from afar, where you can also [**use geolocation**](http://nearbytweets.com/) to find people in that area.

Once the event has taken place there are other sources of information you might look for. For example, did anyone blog about it? Post any audio, video or photos to media sharing sites such as YouTube, Vimeo, Audioboo, or Flickr? Are any of the presentations online (try adding **_filetype:ppt_** or **_filetype:pdf_** to a Google search, or searching platforms like [**Slideshare**](http://slideshare.net/) or [**Scribd**](http://scribd.com/))

Subscribe to Google Alerts for any mentions of the event in future, too -- someone might only write about it or mention it weeks after the event itself, or when the next year's starts to loom.

## 4. Reluctant disclosures

Alongside the formal recording of government business represented by Hansard and TheyWorkForYou (TWFY), there are the disclosures made through Freedom of Information (FOI) and other requests.

[**WhatDoTheyKnow**](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) (WDTK) -- created by the same people who built TWFY -- allows you to follow FOI requests made by people using the site in much the same way you can follow Hansard: through RSS feeds and email alerts based on keywords and phrases, people or organisations.

Needless to say, then, you should be subscribing to alerts on the same basis:

Look at the key terms, places, people and organisations in your field that you are already following on TWFY and subscribe to searches for those. Again, the more specific the better.

Know who the key organisations are in your field and follow FOI requests sent to them. Some general searches, e.g. "crime", will bring up some you won't have thought of. For example, would you have thought of the [**Port of Bristol Police**](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/port_of_bristol_police)? Remember that responsibility for an area will often be spread between specialist agencies and more general bodies, and at both local and national level. For example, an FOI relating to health spending might go to an individual GP (not covered by WDTK, by the way), a Primary Care Trust (PCT), the local authority, or the Department of Health, or any number of other bodies.

Look to see who's making requests on particular subjects. If they're interested in similar things to you, follow the feed for all their requests too. If you can ever add a helpful comment to their requests, do so: you can post comments on FOI requests on WDTK, and that might count for a lot in future if you need a favour back.

Around 10% of FOI requests are made through WhatDoTheyKnow, which means there are another 90% you can't find through this site.

To try to catch those, [**search for 'disclosure log' for bodies in your field**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=%22disclosure+log%22+site%3Anhs.uk). These are pages where the body declares FOI requests received, their status and, in some cases, publishes the responses to them. If there's a feed for the logs, subscribe to it. Otherwise, [**create one**](http://www.feedage.com/html2rss/).

Even if the body does not publish responses, you can use the descriptions and the reference number to request a copy. You can also follow up on others' FOI requests to ask for extra detail or documentation.

A final thing to do is to create a Google Alert for any mentions of "freedom of information" or [**"freedom of information request"**](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=uk&tbm=nws&q=%22freedom+of+information+request%22&oq=%22freedom+of+information+request%22&aq=f&aqi=d2&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=4262l4262l0l4534l1l1l0l0l0l0l161l161l0.1l1l0). This will pick up mentions in news articles based on or "following a freedom of information request", as well as press releases by campaigning groups using FOI.

Note that it will also pick up mentions from the US and other countries where the phrase "freedom of information" is used, so you'll have to tweak your alert to omit results from US and other non-UK news organisations.

Occasionally the journalist or group will publish the full data. They might also be willing to supply it to you, particularly if you can add more analysis. Failing that you might, again, request a copy from the body that it was addressed to (this is harder if the request was sent to dozens of bodies across the country).

## 5. Reports, research and consultations

Reports, research and consultations are a useful source of leads, contacts, and background information. These might come from academic or research institutions, thinktanks, charities, campaigning groups, government departments, political parties, or anyone else.

Some of these get more coverage than others, but it's always best to have access to the original document and data, especially if the group behind it is pushing an agenda. And you should always assume that they are.

Google Alerts comes in handy again here. You can take two tacks here: alerts for the reports themselves; and alerts for articles referring to them.

An alert for the reports themselves is likely to focus on domain extension and file type. Reports tend to be published in PDF format, and by organisations with a web address ending in '.ac.uk' or '.org.uk' (or '.gov.uk'). So try "[**report OR research olympics filetype:pdf site:ac.uk**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=report+OR+research+%2Bolympics+filetype%3Apdf+site%3Aac.uk#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=report+OR+research+olympics+filetype%3Apdf+site%3Aac.uk&oq=report+OR+research+olympics+filetype:pdf+site%3Aac.uk&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=8674l8674l0l10188l1l1l0l0l0l0l594l594l5-1l1l0&gs_l=serp.3...8674l8674l0l10188l1l1l0l0l0l0)" -- or customise based on your own field (e.g. in health add 'site:nhs.uk').

An alert for any news articles should aim to pick up anything not picked up by the above alert. It would limit itself to results from Google News and the key words, e.g. "[**report OR research olympics**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&gl=uk&tbm=nws&q=report+OR+research+olympics&oq=report+OR+research+olympics&aq=f&aqi=d2&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=3679l3679l0l3940l1l1l0l0l0l0l80l80l1l1l0)"

Note that undertaking a survey or releasing 'research' is one of the basic tricks of PR workers seeking coverage. Sometimes they will lack any methodological rigour, and if you cannot get information on the raw data, the sample size, methods and other key details, then you should be very suspicious (and report your suspicions).

## 6. Affected communities

All of the above will only give you a bird's eye view of the field you're covering. You will also need to follow those experiencing the issues and processes being discussed in the reports, debates and the events, and recorded in the data.

A good way to approach this is to map out the process that a 'service user' in your field has to go through. For example, a student's work is marked by lecturers, and moderated by external advisers, all of whom might be working within limits or guidelines set by accreditation bodies, regulators, funding bodies, and internal university working groups. They might access welfare services with different staff and other guidelines, etc.

In health, a patient might see their local GP, a specialist, access patient groups, get support from the local authority and from their own family, and from a charity. Each of those will be working within different regulations, laws, and requirements to report results and other details.

An 'affected' community could be anyone at any stage of that process. For example:

* The patient might suffer from poor care

* Their family has to take time off to fill the gaps in care or pursue complaints

* Their GP lacks support or funds

* The charity worker (or private sector worker) is overworked and frustrated at money being spent on marketing and bids which could be spent on care, or frustrated by some service users exploiting the system

* The private sector company (or charity) is suffering from high turnover of staff because of the demands of local government contracts

The more perspectives you can follow, the better you can understand the picture

Finding feeds for these individuals often takes a bit of rooting around in various social networks, but once you have found one individual, that often leads to others. Here are some avenues to explore:

* Twitter lists and bios -- again, see FollowerWonk, Listorious, etc.

* Related Facebook groups -- look for wall updates posted by people with direct experience

* LinkedIn -- [**search by industry or employer**](http://www.linkedin.com/search?trk=advsrch)

* Blogs -- use a specialist search engine like [**IceRocket**](http://icerocket.com/). Once you've found a blog, look for 'blogrolls' with links to other blogs covering the same topic

* Forums -- [**BoardReader**](http://boardreader.com/) is useful for searching forum posts (and provides an RSS feed). Also try forums on specialist media, such as the BMJ's [**doc2doc**](http://doc2doc.bmj.com/forums.html) for health, [**TES forums**](http://www.tes.co.uk/forums.aspx) for education, and so on.

* Specialist social networks -- many professions have [**their own social networks**](http://www.doctors.net.uk/).

## 7. Experts and observers

This refers to those who study a particular field, rather than those 'at the coalface' within it -- but there will inevitably be some overlap with the previous category. Typical types of expert include the following:

* Insider 'experts' who are employed within the industry full time, part time, or on secondment

* Academic experts who research and/or teach the field. These may also work within the industry on a part time, consultancy or secondment basis, and have probably done so in the past.

* 'Observers' -- individuals who have an interest in monitoring how a particular industry operates, either because they are concerned about its impact on themselves or their loved ones, or because they see commercial or professional opportunities. This also includes...

* Issue campaigners -- people who are interested in an issue which relates to the field. They may be nationally focused, or tackling how an issue plays out locally.

* Retirees -- people who have retired from any of the above positions. One journalistic trick is to follow who leaves the industry, because they will have insider insights without, necessarily, the concern over keeping their job that often comes with that.

* Students -- at the other end of the spectrum are those who wish to enter a field or industry and are studying it. Occasionally individuals in this category will have unique insights through their research, internships, or contacts.

* Bystanders. This is slightly different to those listed above, as their role as 'observer' is generally accidental, and not informed by expertise. However, they also have less reason to skew their description of a particular event. 

The same avenues listed above can be used to find experts and observers. In addition, [**this post on building contacts**](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/how-to-make-contacts) lists other approaches, such as looking at press cuttings, academic journals and university experts directories.

For bystanders, you may want to look at geolocated media (e.g. searching Twitter by location).

## A style guide for collaborative journalism

*The second resource, [A style guide for collaborative journalism](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/12/13/style-guide-collaborative-journalism/), comes from the Online Journalism Blog, and outlines a publishing strategy which you might want to consider as editor of the project.*

It's a few weeks into the [Help Me Investigate: Networks project](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/11/07/announcing-help-me-investigate-networks/) and I've been learning a lot about how community management and investigative journalism can support each other.

Some of this is building on [experiences on the original Help Me Investigate](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/11/08/crowdsourcing-investigative-journalism-a-case-study-part-1/), but one thing in particular is emerging from this project. It's about **how you should write when your intention is to make it easy for others to get involved** -- a different approach to traditional newswriting, but not too different to [good blogging practice](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/11/13/an-attempt-to-define-blogging-as-a-genre/).

It's a style guide, of sorts. And so far I've identified 3 key qualities:

## 1. Write 'news that I can use'

Pull out the practical aspects of what you're writing about. Even if your post is just a link to an article elsewhere, pull out the most useful quote: the facts, the legalities, the implications. If you're writing about an investigation, tell us about the process; link to the full data; translate relevant documents and reports.

Make it useful, because users can build on that to help you in return.

## 2. End your posts with a baton that others can pick up

If it's a work-in-progress, outline **what questions you need to answer next**. This will also help keep your own planning on track. If you're linking to something else, highlight the gaps that need filling -- what information is missing?

Already on [Help Me Investigate Welfare](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/), for example, one investigation has moved from one user's [initial blog post](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/tis-investigation-kick-off-an-foi-request-to-the-dwp), to my setting up the site, to a third person[supplying extra contextual data](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/jsa-claimants-vs-travel-for-interview-scheme-can-you-map-this-data), and a fourth contributor [mapping the results](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/travel-to-interview-jobseekers-allowance). That wouldn't have been possible if the first person had waited and waited until they felt that they were 'finished'. Online, it's the unfinished article that is easier to help with.

## 3. Create momentum by posting small things, often, as you move towards your target

Rather than waiting for things to be perfect, publish as you go. This provides multiple opportunities for others to discover your work, and multiple ways in which to enter it (one post may talk about documents that someone has expertise on; another may profile a particular individual, and so on).

It also makes it clear that the investigation is going somewhere, and the user may be more inclined to help it get there as a result.

Interestingly, one of the journalists on National Public Radio in the US [talks of a similar approach](http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/12/npr-stations-see-big-growth-for-argo-blogs-as-the-pilot-winds-down/):

"[Rina Palta] became a leading reporter on the story, not by writing one big investigative piece but by filing frequent, incremental updates, [NPR's Matt] Thompson said. (Even [Stephen Colbert cited her work](http://informant.kalwnews.org/2010/12/colbert-riffs-on-cali-execution-drug-story/).) Thompson calls it the quest: The body of work makes a bigger impact than any single post."

So there are editorial benefits too.

This style guide works in tandem with a wider content strategy which I'll blog about at some point.

Meanwhile, **what other points would you add to a style guide for collaborative journalism?** (Better still, why not join the project and find out for yourself)
