# [MOVING AWAY FROM 'THE STORY': 5 ROLES OF AN ONLINE INVESTIGATIONS TEAM](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/02/02/moving-away-from-the-story-5-roles-of-an-online-investigations-team/)

In almost a decade of teaching online journalism I repeatedly come up against the same two problems:

* people who are so wedded to the idea of **the self-contained 'story'** that they struggle to create journalism outside of that (e.g. the journalism of linking, liveblogging, updating, explaining, or saying _what they don't know_);

* and people stuck in the habit of **churning out easy-win articles** rather than investing a longer-term effort in something of depth.

Until now I've addressed these problems largely through teaching and individual feedback. But for the next 3 months I'll be trying a new way of _organising_ students that hopes to address those two problems. As always, I thought I'd share it here to see what you think.

## Roles in a team: moving from churnalism to depth

Here's what I'm trying (for context: this is on an undergraduate module [at Birmingham City University](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/media-and-communication-journalism)):

Students are allocated one of 5 roles within a group, investigating a particular public interest question. They investigate that for 6 weeks, at which point they are rotated to a different role and a new investigation (I'm weighing up whether to have some sort of job interview at that point).

The group format allows -- I hope -- for something interesting to happen: students are not under pressure to deliver 'stories', but instead blog about their investigation, as explained below. They are still learning newsgathering techniques, and production techniques, but the team structure makes these explicitly different to those that they would learn elsewhere.

The hope is that it will be much more difficult for them to just transfer print-style stories online, or to reach for he-said/she-said sources to fill the space between ads. With only one story to focus on, students should be forced to engage more, to do deeper and deeper into an issue, and to be more creative in how they communicate what they find out.

_(It's interesting to note that [at least one news organisation is attempting something similar with a restructuring late last year](http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/leadership_blog/comments/20111128_at_the_new_haven_register_reorganization_emphasizes_investigative_/)_

Only one member of the team is primarily concerned with the story, and that is the editor:

## The Editor (ED)

It is the editor's role to identify what exactly the story is that the team is pursuing, and plan how the resources of the team should be best employed in pursuing that. It will help if they form the story as a hypothesis to be tested by the team gathering evidence -- following [Mark Lee Hunter's story based inquiry method (PDF)](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001930/193078e.pdf).

Qualities needed and developed by the editor include:

* A nose for a story

* Project management skills

* Newswriting -- the ability to communicate a story effectively

## The Community Manager (CM)

The community manager's focus is on the communities affected by the story being pursued. They should be engaging regularly with those communities -- contributing to forums, having conversations with members on Twitter; following updates on Facebook; attending real world events; commenting on blogs or photo/video sharing sites, and so on.

They are the two-way channel between that community and the news team: feeding leads from the community to the editor, and taking a lead from the editor in finding contacts from the community (experts, case studies, witnesses).

Qualities needed and developed by the community manager include:

* Interpersonal skills -- the ability to listen to and communicate with different people

* A nose for a story

* Contacts in the community

* Social network research skills -- the ability to find sources and communities online

[6 steps to get started in community management can be found in this follow-up post](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/27/6-ways-to-get-started-in-community-management/).

## The Data Journalist (DJ)

While the community manager is focused on people, the data journalist is focused on documentation: datasets, reports, documents, regulations, and anything that frames the story being pursued.

It is their role to find that documentation -- and to make sense of it. This is a key role because [stories often come from signs being ignored](http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/12/nprs-stateimpact-project-explores-regional-topics-through-focused-data-driven-journalism/) (data) or regulations being ignored (documents).

Qualities needed and developed by the data journalist include:

* Research skills -- advanced online search and use of libraries

* Analysis skills -- such as using spreadsheets

* Ability to decipher jargon -- often by accessing experts (the CM can help)

[Here's a step by step on how to get started as a data journalist](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/04/23/step-by-step-how-to-start-in-a-data-journalist-role/).

## The Multimedia Journalist (MMJ)

The multimedia journalist is focused on the sights, sounds and people that bring a story to life. In an investigation, these will typically be the 'victims' and the 'targets'.

They will film interviews with case studies; organise podcasts where various parties play the story out; collect galleries of images to illustrate the reality behind the words.

They will work closely with the CM as their roles can overlap, especially when accessing sources. The difference is that the CM is concerned with a larger quantity of interactions and information; the MM is concerned with quality: much fewer interactions and richer detail.

Qualities needed and developed by the MMJ include:

* Ability to find sources: experts, witnesses, case studies

* Technical skills: composition; filming or recording; editing

* Planning: pre-interviewing, research, booking kit

## The Network Aggregator (NA)

The NA is the person who keeps the site ticking over while the rest of the team is working on the bigger story.

They publish regular links to related stories around the country. They are also the person who provides the wider context of that story: what else is happening in that field or around that issue; are similar issues arising in other places around the country. Typical content includes backgrounders, explainers, and updates from around the world.

This is the least demanding of the roles, so they should also be available to support other members of the team when required, following up minor leads on related stories. They should not be 'just linking', but getting original stories too, particularly by 'joining the dots' on information coming in.

Qualities needed and developed by the NA include:

* Information management -- following as many feeds, newsletters and other relevant soures of information

* Wide range of contacts -- speaking to the usual suspects regularly to get a feel for the pulse of the issue/sector

* Ability to turn around copy quickly

There's [a post on 7 ways to follow a field as a network aggregator (or any other journalist) on Help Me Investigate](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/7-ways-to-follow-a-field-you-want-to-investig).

And here's a post on '[How to be a network journalist](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/13/how-to-be-a-network-journalist/)'.

Examples of network aggregation in action:

* Blogs like [Created In Birmingham](http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/) regularly round up the latest links to events and other reports in their field. See also The Guardian's [PDA Newsbucket](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2011/aug/03/newsbucket).

* [John Grayson's post on G4S](http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/john-grayson/asylum-seeker-housing-managed-by-for-profit-prison-guards-why-not) uses a topical issue as the angle into a detailed backgrounder on the company with copious links to charity reports, politicians' statements, articles in the media, research projects, and more.

* [This post by Diary of a Benefit Scrounger](http://diaryofabenefitscrounger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/happy-mothers-day.html) is the most creative and powerful example I've yet seen. It combines dozens of links to stories of treatment of benefit claimants and protestors, and to detail on various welfare schemes, to compile a first-person 'story'.

## Publish regular pieces that come together in a larger story

If this works, I'm hoping students will produce different types of content on their way to that 'big story', as follows:

* Linkblogging -- simple posts that link to related articles elsewhere with a key quote (rather than wasting resources rewriting them)

* Profiles of key community members

* Backgrounders and explainers on key issues

* Interviews with experts, case studies and witnesses, published individually first, then edited together later

* Aggregation and curation -- pulling together a gallery of images, for example; or key tweets on an issue; or key facts on a particular area (who, what, where, when, how); or rounding up an event or discussion

* Datablogging -- finding and publishing key datasets and documents and translating them/pulling out key points for a wider audience.

* The story so far -- taking users on a journey of what facts have been discovered, and what remains to be done.

You can [read more on the expectations of each role in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fcjsF7R0efV3ZacIR78nlSaOB1M9RQo0UMghdo2AQUo/edit). And there's a diagram indicating how group members might interact below:

[!](images/OJ_investigations_team.jpg)

What will make the difference is how disciplined the editor is in ensuring that their team keeps moving towards the ultimate aim, and that they can combine the different parts into a significant whole.

UPDATE: A commenter has asked about the end result. Here's how it's explained to students:

"At an identified point, the Editor will need to organise his or her team to bring those ingredients into that bigger story -- and it may be told in different ways, for example:

* A longform text narrative with links to the source material and embedded multimedia

* An edited multimedia package with links to source material in the accompanying description

* A map made with Google Maps, Fusion Tables or another tool, where pins include images or video, and links to each story"

**_If you've any suggestions or experiences on how this might work better, I'd very much welcome them._**

# [HOW TO BE A NETWORK JOURNALIST](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/13/how-to-be-a-network-journalist/)

I've always been interested in the way that journalists rely on 'hotspots': those places and people you check in on if you're looking for a story. What do I mean? Here are just a few examples from traditional journalism:

* The courts

* The emergency services

* The pub (and its landlord)

* Council meetings

* The local vicar

* The post office (think cards in the window)

What's notable about that list is that these are not places where news events necessarily _happen_, but rather where information about them gets _exchanged_: crimes, fires and accidents take place all over town, but most of their perpetrators, heroes and victims eventually end up swapping stories in the same places. Pubs are great places for gossip (and fights), but you can't be there all the time (and keep your job at least).

As more information gets exchanged online, new hotspots appear and old ones become less productive, from a journalistic point of view. Vicars deal with fewer births and marriages; cards move from the post office window to [Freecycle](http://uk.freecycle.org/).

I've written previously about [network infrastructures for journalists online](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/09/26/a-network-infrastructure-for-journalists-online/)...

From A network infrastructure for journalists online

...but I wanted to add to that with some more specific, practical steps for journalists. So over on Help Me Investigate [I've written a guide to 7 pools of sources you can use as a journalist, and how they can inform your real-world digging](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/7-ways-to-follow-a-field-you-want-to-investig). These are the new 'hotspots'.

In case you haven't got time to click through to that post, those 7 are:

1. Prepackaged news

2. Corridors of power

3. Events

4. Reluctant disclosures

5. Reports, research and consultations

6. Affected communities

7. Experts and observers

Can you add any others?

## [7 ways to follow a field you want to investigate](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/7-ways-to-follow-a-field-you-want-to-investig)

Here's a part by part guide to how you can follow different 'streams' of information as a journalist to understand what's going on in a particular field, and how they can inform your real-world digging. Most of them involve using an RSS reader like Google Reader to follow feeds to keep in touch with developments.

## 1. Prepackaged news

While much is made of the 'exclusive' in journalism, and students will be harangued for recycling work done by other journalists, the truth is that the first thing most journalists do every day is check out their competitors, and get a feel for the current news agenda. A journalist has to balance being 'on top' of developments that others are covering ("Why don't we have something on this story?"), while also reporting information that others don't have.

[**Journalisted**](http://journalisted.com/) provides feeds for most national journalists and many regional ones too. Sadly there's no way (that I know of) to browse by specialist field, However you can use a search like [**"health correspondent" site:journalisted.com**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=%22health+correspondent%22+site%3Ajournalisted.com) to get a good idea.

This will omit those whose bios don't describe their specialism, however. So an alternative tack is to pick a particular story which you would assume most reporters in a particular field will have covered, and search for mentions of that on Journalisted.

With most journalists now on Twitter, it's also worth looking for lists of correspondents or departments (e.g. [**@GdnHealthcare**](http://twitter.com/GdnHealthcare)). You can [**search Twitter bios on FollowerWonk**](http://followerwonk.com/), there are Twitter list directories on [**Twibes**](http://www.twibes.com/),[**Listorious**](http://listorious.com/), and [**other sites**](http://www.jasonbartholme.com/21-twitter-directories-and-follower-finders-to-expand-your-twittersphere/), or you can simply [**search Google for the type of Twitter list you're after**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=twitter+list+directory+health#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=twitter+list+health&oq=twitter+list+health&aq=f&aqi=g-v4&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=137148l137148l0l137498l1l1l0l0l0l0l128l128l0.1l1l0&gs_l=serp.3..0i15l4.137148l137148l0l137499l1l1l0l0l0l0l128l128l0j1l1l0&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.).

Following specialist journalists and departments will only tell you what's already being reported, however. You'll need to follow a lot more feeds to move up the news food chain.

## 2. Corridors of power

If something is important, chances are it will end up being raised or discussed around Parliament at some point. People may write to their local MP just as readily as a local journalist, and organisations may raise issues as part of a submission to a [**select committee**](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/select/) that they wouldn't otherwise air publicly.

This applies whether you're covering an obviously political field, like health, or something less clearly political, such as sport or the arts -- both of which receive government funding and are subject to regulations and processes laid down by politicians and civil servants.

It's important, then, to keep on top of what's being discussed in the corridors of power -- whether that is Prime Minister's Questions, Written Answers, select committees, or one of the many other discussions and meetings that take place in Westminster and elsewhere.

[**TheyWorkForYou**](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/) is a good first port of call on this front, as it provides email and RSS alerts for everything recorded in Parliament (for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland you should also follow your national parliament or assembly). Here are some suggestions:

* Identify key terms, places, people and organisations in your field and subscribe to searches for those. The more specific the better: "[**apprenticeships**](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?s=apprenticeships)" rather than "training", for example.

* Know who the key ministers are in your field and follow what they say. For example, Michael Gove may be the Secretary of State for Education, but universities come under [**BIS**](http://www.bis.gov.uk/) (the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills), and [**the universities minister is David Willetts**](http://www.bis.gov.uk/ministers/david-willetts). The shadow universities minister is Shabana Mahmood ([**more on shadow ministers here**](http://www.labour.org.uk/shadow-cabinet)). The ministers for education in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are [**John O'Dowd**](http://www.deni.gov.uk/index/85-about-the-dept/about-dept-education-structure-pg/41-about-the-department-structure-and-functions-education-minister-pg.htm), [**Michael Russell**](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/14944/Scottish-Cabinet/michaelrussellmsp) and [**Leighton Andrews**](http://wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetm/leightonandrews?lang=en)respectively, and so on.

* There may also be members of the House of Lords with particular professional backgrounds or interests who are relevant -- try a [**search limited to the Lords biographies pages**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=professor+site%3Awww.parliament.uk%2Fbiographies%2Flords%2F)(site:www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/).

* Look for [**ongoing and upcoming consultations**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=consultations+site%3Agov.uk). These invite people to submit their thoughts on a particular area or issue, and can lead you to people (experts in your field, people with interesting experiences), information (reports, statistics and research) and leads (problems, conflicts, unsupported claims, etc.) Again, there will be separate consultations for devolved nations.

Each government department has a list of ongoing and upcoming consultations, and you can normally find links to the formal submissions. If there is a feed, subscribe. If not, [**make one**](http://www.feedage.com/html2rss/).

There are also other mailing lists you should look out for and follow. For example, [**Info4local**](http://www.info4local.gov.uk/) is particularly useful, allowing you to select from a range of locations, bodies and topics.

For more on finding information from parliamentary sources, see this video of Jon Walker, a Westminster correspondent for the Birmingham Post & Mail:

## 3. Events

Events provide a number of useful pieces of information to the network journalist. Firstly, they provide an indication of talking points within a particular field, and their perceived importance: what is the keynote about? The panel discussions? If attendees choose threads of discussion, or elect to go to one over another, what do they choose?

Secondly, they provide a list of potential contacts: the speakers, certainly, but also those attending if the list is published on an Eventbrite page, for example. Even if the list is not published, you can make a note to search for "going to X" on social networks, and to look for mentions while the event is taking place (which will also direct you to people within the field who are not attending but who are talking about the event anyway).

Obviously you want to attend the event yourself: making contacts in person is invariably more effective than online approaches, and just listening to the chatter between people can give you insights you won't otherwise get.

It also makes it easier to find people talking about the location 'near you' using social media apps that incorporate search by location (e.g. [**Osfoora**](http://www.osfoora.com/) or[**Flickr's map**](http://www.flickr.com/map/)). 

If that's not possible you can still pick up a lot of information from following the event from afar, where you can also [**use geolocation**](http://nearbytweets.com/) to find people in that area.

Once the event has taken place there are other sources of information you might look for. For example, did anyone blog about it? Post any audio, video or photos to media sharing sites such as YouTube, Vimeo, Audioboo, or Flickr? Are any of the presentations online (try adding **_filetype:ppt_** or **_filetype:pdf_** to a Google search, or searching platforms like [**Slideshare**](http://slideshare.net/) or [**Scribd**](http://scribd.com/))

Subscribe to Google Alerts for any mentions of the event in future, too -- someone might only write about it or mention it weeks after the event itself, or when the next year's starts to loom.

## 4. Reluctant disclosures

Alongside the formal recording of government business represented by Hansard and TheyWorkForYou (TWFY), there are the disclosures made through Freedom of Information (FOI) and other requests.

[**WhatDoTheyKnow**](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) (WDTK) -- created by the same people who built TWFY -- allows you to follow FOI requests made by people using the site in much the same way you can follow Hansard: through RSS feeds and email alerts based on keywords and phrases, people or organisations.

Needless to say, then, you should be subscribing to alerts on the same basis:

Look at the key terms, places, people and organisations in your field that you are already following on TWFY and subscribe to searches for those. Again, the more specific the better.

Know who the key organisations are in your field and follow FOI requests sent to them. Some general searches, e.g. "crime", will bring up some you won't have thought of. For example, would you have thought of the [**Port of Bristol Police**](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/port_of_bristol_police)? Remember that responsibility for an area will often be spread between specialist agencies and more general bodies, and at both local and national level. For example, an FOI relating to health spending might go to an individual GP (not covered by WDTK, by the way), a Primary Care Trust (PCT), the local authority, or the Department of Health, or any number of other bodies.

Look to see who's making requests on particular subjects. If they're interested in similar things to you, follow the feed for all their requests too. If you can ever add a helpful comment to their requests, do so: you can post comments on FOI requests on WDTK, and that might count for a lot in future if you need a favour back.

Around 10% of FOI requests are made through WhatDoTheyKnow, which means there are another 90% you can't find through this site.

To try to catch those, [**search for 'disclosure log' for bodies in your field**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=%22disclosure+log%22+site%3Anhs.uk). These are pages where the body declares FOI requests received, their status and, in some cases, publishes the responses to them. If there's a feed for the logs, subscribe to it. Otherwise, [**create one**](http://www.feedage.com/html2rss/).

Even if the body does not publish responses, you can use the descriptions and the reference number to request a copy. You can also follow up on others' FOI requests to ask for extra detail or documentation.

A final thing to do is to create a Google Alert for any mentions of "freedom of information" or [**"freedom of information request"**](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=uk&tbm=nws&q=%22freedom+of+information+request%22&oq=%22freedom+of+information+request%22&aq=f&aqi=d2&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=4262l4262l0l4534l1l1l0l0l0l0l161l161l0.1l1l0). This will pick up mentions in news articles based on or "following a freedom of information request", as well as press releases by campaigning groups using FOI.

Note that it will also pick up mentions from the US and other countries where the phrase "freedom of information" is used, so you'll have to tweak your alert to omit results from US and other non-UK news organisations.

Occasionally the journalist or group will publish the full data. They might also be willing to supply it to you, particularly if you can add more analysis. Failing that you might, again, request a copy from the body that it was addressed to (this is harder if the request was sent to dozens of bodies across the country).

## 5. Reports, research and consultations

Reports, research and consultations are a useful source of leads, contacts, and background information. These might come from academic or research institutions, thinktanks, charities, campaigning groups, government departments, political parties, or anyone else.

Some of these get more coverage than others, but it's always best to have access to the original document and data, especially if the group behind it is pushing an agenda. And you should always assume that they are.

Google Alerts comes in handy again here. You can take two tacks here: alerts for the reports themselves; and alerts for articles referring to them.

An alert for the reports themselves is likely to focus on domain extension and file type. Reports tend to be published in PDF format, and by organisations with a web address ending in '.ac.uk' or '.org.uk' (or '.gov.uk'). So try "[**report OR research olympics filetype:pdf site:ac.uk**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=hea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=report+OR+research+%2Bolympics+filetype%3Apdf+site%3Aac.uk#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=report+OR+research+olympics+filetype%3Apdf+site%3Aac.uk&oq=report+OR+research+olympics+filetype:pdf+site%3Aac.uk&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=8674l8674l0l10188l1l1l0l0l0l0l594l594l5-1l1l0&gs_l=serp.3...8674l8674l0l10188l1l1l0l0l0l0)" -- or customise based on your own field (e.g. in health add 'site:nhs.uk').

An alert for any news articles should aim to pick up anything not picked up by the above alert. It would limit itself to results from Google News and the key words, e.g. "[**report OR research olympics**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&gl=uk&tbm=nws&q=report+OR+research+olympics&oq=report+OR+research+olympics&aq=f&aqi=d2&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=3679l3679l0l3940l1l1l0l0l0l0l80l80l1l1l0)"

Note that undertaking a survey or releasing 'research' is one of the basic tricks of PR workers seeking coverage. Sometimes they will lack any methodological rigour, and if you cannot get information on the raw data, the sample size, methods and other key details, then you should be very suspicious (and report your suspicions).

## 6. Affected communities

All of the above will only give you a bird's eye view of the field you're covering. You will also need to follow those experiencing the issues and processes being discussed in the reports, debates and the events, and recorded in the data.

A good way to approach this is to map out the process that a 'service user' in your field has to go through. For example, a student's work is marked by lecturers, and moderated by external advisers, all of whom might be working within limits or guidelines set by accreditation bodies, regulators, funding bodies, and internal university working groups. They might access welfare services with different staff and other guidelines, etc.

In health, a patient might see their local GP, a specialist, access patient groups, get support from the local authority and from their own family, and from a charity. Each of those will be working within different regulations, laws, and requirements to report results and other details.

An 'affected' community could be anyone at any stage of that process. For example:

* The patient might suffer from poor care

* Their family has to take time off to fill the gaps in care or pursue complaints

* Their GP lacks support or funds

* The charity worker (or private sector worker) is overworked and frustrated at money being spent on marketing and bids which could be spent on care, or frustrated by some service users exploiting the system

* The private sector company (or charity) is suffering from high turnover of staff because of the demands of local government contracts

The more perspectives you can follow, the better you can understand the picture

Finding feeds for these individuals often takes a bit of rooting around in various social networks, but once you have found one individual, that often leads to others. Here are some avenues to explore:

* Twitter lists and bios -- again, see FollowerWonk, Listorious, etc.

* Related Facebook groups -- look for wall updates posted by people with direct experience

* LinkedIn -- [**search by industry or employer**](http://www.linkedin.com/search?trk=advsrch)

* Blogs -- use a specialist search engine like [**IceRocket**](http://icerocket.com/). Once you've found a blog, look for 'blogrolls' with links to other blogs covering the same topic

* Forums -- [**BoardReader**](http://boardreader.com/) is useful for searching forum posts (and provides an RSS feed). Also try forums on specialist media, such as the BMJ's [**doc2doc**](http://doc2doc.bmj.com/forums.html) for health, [**TES forums**](http://www.tes.co.uk/forums.aspx) for education, and so on.

* Specialist social networks -- many professions have [**their own social networks**](http://www.doctors.net.uk/).

## 7. Experts and observers

This refers to those who study a particular field, rather than those 'at the coalface' within it -- but there will inevitably be some overlap with the previous category. Typical types of expert include the following:

* Insider 'experts' who are employed within the industry full time, part time, or on secondment

* Academic experts who research and/or teach the field. These may also work within the industry on a part time, consultancy or secondment basis, and have probably done so in the past.

* 'Observers' -- individuals who have an interest in monitoring how a particular industry operates, either because they are concerned about its impact on themselves or their loved ones, or because they see commercial or professional opportunities. This also includes...

* Issue campaigners -- people who are interested in an issue which relates to the field. They may be nationally focused, or tackling how an issue plays out locally.

* Retirees -- people who have retired from any of the above positions. One journalistic trick is to follow who leaves the industry, because they will have insider insights without, necessarily, the concern over keeping their job that often comes with that.

* Students -- at the other end of the spectrum are those who wish to enter a field or industry and are studying it. Occasionally individuals in this category will have unique insights through their research, internships, or contacts.

* Bystanders. This is slightly different to those listed above, as their role as 'observer' is generally accidental, and not informed by expertise. However, they also have less reason to skew their description of a particular event. 

The same avenues listed above can be used to find experts and observers. In addition, [**this post on building contacts**](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/how-to-make-contacts) lists other approaches, such as looking at press cuttings, academic journals and university experts directories.

For bystanders, you may want to look at geolocated media (e.g. searching Twitter by location).

# [6 WAYS TO GET STARTED IN COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/27/6-ways-to-get-started-in-community-management/)

Following on from [my previous post on the network journalist role](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/13/how-to-be-a-network-journalist/), and as part of a wider experiment around the [5 roles in an investigations team](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/02/02/moving-away-from-the-story-5-roles-of-an-online-investigations-team/), I wanted to flesh out what exactly a **community editor role** means when adopted as part of a journalism project.

First I need to add a disclaimer: the terms "community editor" (CE) and "community manager" (CM) are used to refer to a very wide range of jobs in a number of industries. I'm not sure what distinction there is -- if any -- but my hunch is that the title 'community editor' has been overtaken by its 'manager' variation because it rightly places the focus more on the community than its content.

Even within journalism, the role can vary enormously. This is partly because the communities themselves, and the challenges that they represent, differ so much. For example:

* A mass market -- anonymous and diverse, which a CM must try to somehow 'convert' into one or more healthy niche communities

* No community -- the CM is asked to 'build it from scratch'

* The CM's website(s) already have active communities. The CM's role is to maintain, support, and further develop those.

* Communities exist, but not on the website(s) of the CM's employer -- the CM is asked to engage with those (this is more of a Community Editor role)

This post will be dealing with the last situation, which is the one in which most journalists first find themselves: with **neither a platform nor a community**.

With that out of the way, here are **6 things I think an individual can do as part of their first foray into community management/editing as a journalist**:

## 1. Know where the communities are

This seems like a no-brainer but it's all too easy to miss communities because you can't find any evidence of them on Twitter or Facebook.

Along with **specialist social networks** (LinkedIn for professionals; MySpace for musicians; even profession-specific networks such as [Doctors.net](http://www.doctors.net.uk/)), there are **forums, wikis, mailing lists**, and various other places where people gather to share information and support.

The [social media prism](http://www.theconversationprism.com/) by Brian Solis is one useful tool for checking if you've covered every possible angle on this front. For example: have you thought of [looking for your community on Flickr](http://www.edwalker.net/blog/2012/01/14/flickr-the-forgotten-but-potentially-most-useful-social-network-for-hyperlocal-and-local-news-sites/)? Last.fm? Digg? A locally popular platform? (LiveJournal dominates in eastern Europe, for example, while QQ is China's answer to Twitter, [Mixi is Japan](http://www.allfacebook.com/facebook-japan-2012-03?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+allfacebook+%28Facebook+Blog%29)'s answer to Facebook, and Orkut and Hi5 have a healthy userbase in places like Brazil and India)

Look for the communities in every corner of the net -- don't expect them to come pre-labelled. For example, the forums of local football clubs and local newspapers often contain corners devoted to topics other than football and news. And **follow people as well as topics**: if you find someone in your field, search for their username across the web and see what other places they contribute to.

One other place to look: the physical world. Live **events, conferences, meetups**and other gatherings are ideal places to build relationships with members of the community -- as well as a great opportunity for providing live coverage online that will lead you to others, and others to you.

## 2. Look for problems to solve

Once you've identified and are following the community, try to find your best role within it. Remember that the community is not here to serve _you_: barging in and asking for case studies will get you the same response as if you did that in any physical social space: blank stares and muttered insults.

The simplest way to find a place in a community is through solving problems.

Listen for **questions** that people are asking, or **complaints** that they make. A key skill of a journalist is to find the answers to questions, or get responses to complaints -- so that's likely to be one way you can contribute.

Those answers and responses, of course, also make for good **evergreen content**(which can help you attract other members of the community), so cross-post them on your blog as well as on the platforms where the community gathers.

You might also see the need for physical meetups or other events -- don't be afraid to get stuck in and organise one.

## 3. Be interested -- listen and ask questions

You will be both a better journalist and community editor if you listen as much as possible, and ask when you want to hear more about something.

It doesn't have to be newsworthy -- in fact, it's sometimes better when it's not -- because often it's an **understanding of the small details and complex context**which makes for better journalism and, by extension, better -- and more -- relationships with contacts.

## 4. Create content out of the process of discovery

As you explore a community a good practice to adopt is to record your research in ways that make it easier for others to engage with the community too. This helps you see what is interesting about a community, as well as creating content which can help contacts find you.

Examples of typical content created from the process of community research include:

* 'Top 20 people in [an industry] to follow on Twitter'

* 'The best forums for [your field or issue]'

* 'The hottest discussions about the [issue] right now'

* 'Where do [profession] go for advice on [problem]?'

* 'The best blogs about [your field/issue]'

* 'Forums roundup: what people are saying about [issue/question]'

You may need to make a choice on where to post this content, especially if the community is not a big user of blogs. Don't publish in a way that is disconnected from the community that you are supposed to be serving: at the very least cross-publish to the platforms where discussion is healthiest. Don't spam shared spaces with links to external content.

You might also profile members of the community, or -- at a later stage -- create something that pulls together profiles, points of view, or experiences. For example:[this Times Educational Supplement piece collects excluded pupils' experiences](http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6193911) (incomplete version online); [We Are The 99 Percent](http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/) uses Tumblr to pull together the experiences that inspired a protest movement; and [Spitalfields Life seeks to document the places and people of the area](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/mar/20/tales-from-city-local-blogs?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+%28Media%29), while [this Guardian interactive allows you to explore the voices of 100 NHS workers on health reforms](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/interactive/2012/mar/15/nhs-reforms-100-voices-interactive).

## 5. Link, retweet, attribute and comment

Finally, it's important to link to content from your community as often as possible. This does two things: firstly, it demonstrates good attribution and demonstrates that you are not looking to take credit for yourself which belongs to others. And secondly, it makes other people aware of your work: a link to another blog generates a 'pingback' which alerts the author to your piece. Twitter users are notified if their tweet is retweeted by you, Facebook users if you 'like' their update, and so on. Comments are an extension of the same principle of acknowledgement.

Linking -- or 'linkblogging' -- is also the simplest way to begin engaging with a field and its communities, and a good habit to get into if you want to understand an area and get in the habit of keeping up to date with it. For more on that, [7 ways to follow a field...](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/7-ways-to-follow-a-field-you-want-to-investig) is a good guide.

## 6. Read about community management

As you gain in confidence and reputation, you may find yourself doing more and more in your community. Community management is, to my mind, one of the hardest roles in online journalism to do well, and the more insights you can gather from others, the better prepared you will be.

[This list of resources from FeverBee](http://www.feverbee.com/2012/02/how-to-build-an-online-community.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Feverbee+%28FeverBee+-+Practical+advice+for+building+online+communities%29) is as good as they come. You should also follow blogs in the field -- that list contains a section on those, but if you just want 5 to start with, [here's a bundle to subscribe to](http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F12323076578145270806%2Fbundle%2F5community).

# [STEP BY STEP: HOW TO START IN A DATA JOURNALIST ROLE](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/04/23/step-by-step-how-to-start-in-a-data-journalist-role/)

Following my previous [posts on the network journalist](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/13/how-to-be-a-network-journalist/) and [community manager roles](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/27/6-ways-to-get-started-in-community-management/) as part of an [investigation team](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/02/02/moving-away-from-the-story-5-roles-of-an-online-investigations-team/), this post expands on **the first steps a student journalist can take in filling the data journalist role**.

## 1: Brainstorm data that might be relevant to your investigation or field

Before you begin digging for data, it's worth mapping out the territory you're working in. Some key questions to ask include:

* Who **measures or monitors** your field? For example:

* regulators and inspectors

* charities (try searching by keyword on the [Charity Commission](http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/) or [OpenCharities](http://opencharities.org/))

* campaigning groups

* central government (the [department and/or agency responsible](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/A-ZOfCentralGovernment/index.htm), e.g. Ministry of Justice, BIS, etc. -- there may also be [specific ministers](http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/about-us/people/ministers/))

* local government (local authorities or [primary care trusts](http://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/PrimaryCareTrustListing.aspx), [police force, etc](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Diol1/DoItOnline/DG_4017475).)

* select committees (browse [parliamentary research indexed here](http://www.parliament.uk/topics/Topical-Issues.htm), or try a [specific search](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?rlz=1C1GPCK_enGB454GB455&sourceid=chrome-instant&ix=seb&ie=UTF-8&ion=1#hl=en&rlz=1C1GPCK_enGB454GB455&sclient=psy-ab&q=select+committee+on+schools&oq=select+committee+on+schools&aq=f&aqi=g-v2&aql=&gs_l=serp.3..0i15l2.5267l7529l3l7662l16l16l0l9l9l0l124l598l4j3l7l0.frgbld.&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=3181f87014c))

* general statistical/audit bodies such as [ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html) or the [Audit Commission](http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Pages/default.aspx).

* Where is **spending** recorded? This might be at both a [local](http://openlylocal.com/councils/spending) and [national](http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org/spending.html) level.

* What are the key **things that might be measured** in your field? For example, in prisons they might be interested in reoffending, or overcrowding, or staffing.

* Can you find historical data?

* What data do you need to provide **basic context**? e.g.

* Where -- addresses for all institutions in your field (e.g. schools, prisons, etc.)

* Codes -- often these are used instead of institution or area names

* Who -- names of those responsible for particular aspects of your field

* Demographics -- the distribution of age, gender, ethnicity, industries, wealth, property or other elements may be important to your work

* Politics -- who is in charge in each area (local authority and local MP)

* How could you collate data that doesn't exist? E.g. public awareness of something; or how the policies of different bodies compare, etc.

Sometimes the simplest and quickest way to find out these things is to pick up the phone and speak to someone in a relevant organisation and ask them: what information is collected about your field, and by whom?

You can also make content from this process of research: **post a guide to how your field is regulated and measured** (and what information isn't); **who's who in your field** - the regulators, monitors, politicians and bodies that all have a hand in keeping it on track.

## 2. Learn advanced techniques to obtain that data

Once you've mapped it all out you can start to prioritise the datasets that are most relevant to your particular investigation. You may need to use different techniques to get hold of these, including:

* Advanced search techniques ([limit by filetype:, site:, etc.](http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators.html))

* Simply picking up the phone to call the relevant department (try to get as much detailed data as possible rather than aggregate, i.e. very general, figures)

* [Using FOI requests](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/tag/foi)

* [Converting PDFs into spreadsheets](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/7-ways-to-get-data-out-of-pdfs)

* [Scraping](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/tag/scraping/)

Again, you can make content from this process, for example: "**How we found...**" or "**Why we're asking the MoJ for...**" (with a link to the FOI request) or "[**Get the data**](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/data-disability-and-other-hate-crime)" (here's [how to publish data online](http://helpmeinvestigate.posterous.com/how-do-i-publish-my-data-online))

The flow chart below ([from this previous post](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/09/06/gathering-data-a-flow-chart-for-data-journalists/)) helps guide you to the relevant techniques for your data:

Gathering data: a flow chart for data journalist

## 3. Pull out the parts of data relevant to your field/investigation

For example:

* If the data covers every region, pull out [the parts that apply to your locality](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/education/2011/11/the-price-of-a-university-drop-out-4-time-for-some-numbers/), or [how that compares to other areas](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/travel-to-interview-jobseekers-allowance) (space), or to previous data (time)

* Look at the particular issue(s) that interests you in the data, e.g. a particular crime out of many, or a particular indicator. How does that [compare across space](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/health/2012/02/22/public-health-spending-now-and-to-come-data-and-documents/) (regions) or time?

## 4. Add value to the data

Here are just some suggestions. You can use one or many:

* [Combine datasets](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/education/2012/01/free-school-meals-in-scottish-primary-schools-data-visualisation/) - e.g. one may have school ratings; another may have the addresses of all schools, or their local authority

* Convert data -- this amounts to much the same thing, but for example: postcodes are more useful [when converted into lat/long coordinates](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2010/12/16/adding-geographical-information-to-a-spreadsheet-based-on-postcodes-google-refine-and-apis/) (likewise [easting and northing](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/08/12/how-to-convert-eastingnorthing-into-latlong-for-an-interactive-map/))

* Find out how the data was collected and/or measured (put simply: pick up the phone and ask)

* Get an independent expert perspective on the data

* [Compare the data with official claims or spin](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/) - does it really back those claims up?

* Compare the data with reports from elsewhere -- is [anything missing](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/01/31/revealed-the-dead-not-included-in-the-official-figures/)?

* Unpick jargon and definitions (here's an example of [James Ball unpicking different work experience schemes](http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/feb/22/unemployment-work-programme-welfare))

* Add a [search and filter interface](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/03/28/a-useful-tool-for-creating-a-search-interface-for-your-data-freedive/)

Any of these provide useful opportunities for posting new content with the new contextual information (e.g. "**How the data on X was gathered**") or new combined data ("[**Now with QOF data**](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/health/2012/02/15/data-gp-patient-lists-now-with-qof-data/)") or the issues that they raise ("[**Why schools data may be worthless**](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/how-dodgy-stats-could-decide-our-childrens-future)").

## 5. Communicate the story in the data

I've[ written separately about the different ways of communicating data stories, so you can read that here](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/07/13/the-inverted-pyramid-of-data-journalism-part-2-6-ways-of-communicating-data-journalism/). In short, human case studies are helpful, and visualisation is often useful.

And it's at this point that you can also link to the further detail provided in all the content you've written in the previous 4 steps: How you got the data, the wider context, the specific data that's of interest, the more detailed expert analysis or background, and so on.

# [A STYLE GUIDE FOR COLLABORATIVE JOURNALISM: WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THE FIRST WEEKS OF HELP ME INVESTIGATE: NETWORKS](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/12/13/style-guide-collaborative-journalism/)

It's a few weeks into the [Help Me Investigate: Networks project](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/11/07/announcing-help-me-investigate-networks/) and I've been learning a lot about how community management and investigative journalism can support each other.

Some of this is building on [experiences on the original Help Me Investigate](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/11/08/crowdsourcing-investigative-journalism-a-case-study-part-1/), but one thing in particular is emerging from this project. It's about **how you should write when your intention is to make it easy for others to get involved** -- a different approach to traditional newswriting, but not too different to [good blogging practice](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/11/13/an-attempt-to-define-blogging-as-a-genre/).

It's a style guide, of sorts. And so far I've identified 3 key qualities:

## 1. Write 'news that I can use'

Pull out the practical aspects of what you're writing about. Even if your post is just a link to an article elsewhere, pull out the most useful quote: the facts, the legalities, the implications. If you're writing about an investigation, tell us about the process; link to the full data; translate relevant documents and reports.

Make it useful, because users can build on that to help you in return.

## 2. End your posts with a baton that others can pick up

If it's a work-in-progress, outline **what questions you need to answer next**. This will also help keep your own planning on track. If you're linking to something else, highlight the gaps that need filling -- what information is missing?

Already on [Help Me Investigate Welfare](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/), for example, one investigation has moved from one user's [initial blog post](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/tis-investigation-kick-off-an-foi-request-to-the-dwp), to my setting up the site, to a third person[supplying extra contextual data](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/jsa-claimants-vs-travel-for-interview-scheme-can-you-map-this-data), and a fourth contributor [mapping the results](http://helpmeinvestigate.com/welfare/travel-to-interview-jobseekers-allowance). That wouldn't have been possible if the first person had waited and waited until they felt that they were 'finished'. Online, it's the unfinished article that is easier to help with.

## 3. Create momentum by posting small things, often, as you move towards your target

Rather than waiting for things to be perfect, publish as you go. This provides multiple opportunities for others to discover your work, and multiple ways in which to enter it (one post may talk about documents that someone has expertise on; another may profile a particular individual, and so on).

It also makes it clear that the investigation is going somewhere, and the user may be more inclined to help it get there as a result.

Interestingly, one of the journalists on National Public Radio in the US [talks of a similar approach](http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/12/npr-stations-see-big-growth-for-argo-blogs-as-the-pilot-winds-down/):

"[Rina Palta] became a leading reporter on the story, not by writing one big investigative piece but by filing frequent, incremental updates, [NPR's Matt] Thompson said. (Even [Stephen Colbert cited her work](http://informant.kalwnews.org/2010/12/colbert-riffs-on-cali-execution-drug-story/).) Thompson calls it the quest: The body of work makes a bigger impact than any single post."

So there are editorial benefits too.

This style guide works in tandem with a wider content strategy which I'll blog about at some point.

Meanwhile, **what other points would you add to a style guide for collaborative journalism?** (Better still, why not join the project and find out for yourself)

# [HOW TO GET STARTED AS A MULTIMEDIA JOURNALIST](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/08/21/how-to-get-started-as-a-multimedia-journalist/)

I've now covered almost all of the [5 roles in an investigations team](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2012/02/02/moving-away-from-the-story-5-roles-of-an-online-investigations-team/) I posted about earlier this year -- apart from the **multimedia journalist role**. So here's how to get started in that role.

Multimedia journalism is a pretty nebulous term. As a result, in my experience, when students try to adopt the role two main problems recur: 1) having a narrow assumption of what multimedia means (i.e. video) and 2) not being able to see the multimedia possibilities of your work.

Multimedia journalism is a very different beast to broadcast journalism. In broadcast journalism your role was comparatively simple: you had one medium to use, and a well-worn format to employ.

Put another way: **in broadcast journalism the medium was _imposed_ on the story; in multimedia journalism, the _story_ imposes the medium.**

Multimedia also has to deal with [the style challenge](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/07/25/the-style-challenge/) I've written about previously:

>"Not only must they be able to adapt their style for different types of _reporting_; not only must they be able to adapt for different _brands_; not only must they be able to adapt their style within different brands across multiple _media_; but they must also be able to adapt their style within a single medium, across multiple **_platforms_**: Twitter, Facebook, blogs, Flickr, YouTube, or anywhere else that their audiences gather."

With that in mind, then, here are 4 steps to get started in multimedia journalism:

## Step 1: Look for multimedia opportunities in your journalism

The style challenge outlined above means starting from a position of having to decide what medium to use -- and the type of multimedia which is produced in this role will depend largely on the nature of the stories and investigations being pursued. Here are some typical examples of where multimedia can bring an extra dimension to a story:

* **Case studies**: video or audio interviews with someone at the heart of the story: affected by the issue or working at the coalface

* **Reaction**: video or audio interview with the person responsible: capturing their attempts to explain their role

* **Clarity**: charts, maps or infographic turning data into something that users can understand more quickly. Tools useful here include Google Charts and Gadgets (in Google Docs), Many Eyes and Tableau for charts; Tagxedo, Wordle or Many Eyes for word clouds; Google Maps and BatchGeo for maps; and Infogr.am for infographics.

* **Explanation**: taking something complex and making it accessible to a wider audience -- this might be done through a graphic, or through a video or audio interview with an expert who can explain it clearly -- including a member of the team

* **Conflict and chemistry**: staging a podcast discussion to flesh out the key themes in the issue being explored. This can be done in an entertaining way if your presenters have chemistry, or it can be done in an engaging way if you have two camps in conflict (make sure you can add clarity and expertise into the noise)

* **Interactivity**: producing something that users can interact with. Freedive is a useful tool for doing this with spreadsheets. There are also timeline tools like Dipity and Meograph, and charts and maps can be interactive too.

The multimedia journalist needs to be able to spot those opportunities for multimedia to play a role -- and develop the skills to see them through. Here are some questions to ask:

* Does the story involve complex concepts that might be better illustrated through visual or aural means?

* Does the story require a response from someone, or a description of an event, where non-verbal cues such as their tone of voice or facial expression may be key?

* Are there different positions which would suit a discussion to flesh them out?

* Is there so much information involved that users might want to explore it themselves to pull out the bits directly relevant to them?

* Does the story involve figures or data that work better visually than in text?

Looking at plenty of examples of online multimedia is very important here. For the reasons explained above, broadcast journalism is not always the best example to follow. Look at David McCandless's [visualisation work](http://www.davidmccandless.com/design_work/) or the discussions about best practice on [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/). Look at the video work of [Travis Fox](http://www.travisfox.com/) and Michael Rosenblum's [students](http://www.rosenblumtv.com/). Watch The Guardian's x[video](http://www.guardian.co.uk/video) and the [documentary channel](http://vimeo.com/channels/documentaryfilm) on Vimeo. Listen to the most [popular podcasts](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/) and [micropodcasts](http://audioboo.fm/boos/featured); soak in [audio slideshows](http://delicious.com/paulb/audioslideshow) -- and ask yourself what makes them so effective.

The technical quality -- and I know people will disagree with this -- can wait.

## Step 2: Plan and practise

The reason that I place technical skills second here is this: if you don't have a story to tell, you are going to have neither the means nor the motive to develop your technical skills.

Furthermore, because there are now so many technical options available to the journalist, learning them all before going out to report is not the most efficient option.

So: **story first, technicalities second**.

Once you have a story, you have to decide how best to tell it. If it's video, you will need to learn that. If maps, then look at that. Don't wait for someone to show you how: there are thousands of resources online to get you started, from [Vimeo's Video School](https://vimeo.com/videoschool) and [YouTube's Playbook](http://www.youtube.com/yt/creators/playbook.html) to the [BBC College's resources](http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/collegeofjournalism/how-to) and [Mindy McAdams's collection on audio and video production](http://mindymcadams.com/tojou/2009/now-printable-reporters-guide-to-multimedia-proficiency/). YouTube has tons of tutorials on pretty much [any](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mapping+data+fusion+tables&oq=mapping+data+fusion+tables&gs_l=youtube.3...7764.9089.0.9230.14.12.0.0.0.0.109.702.11j1.12.0...0.0...1ac.7YNu6htN8mY) skill you might want to tackle, but there are also text resources such as The Society of Professional Journalists' [Digital Media Handbook Part 1 (PDF)](http://blogs.spjnetwork.org/tech/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SPJDigitalMediaHandbookV3.pdf) and [Part 2](http://www.scribd.com/doc/38506672/Society-of-Professional-Journalists-Digital-Media-Handbook-Part-II) which cover mapping and data visualisation, among other useful techniques, and the Knight Digital Media Center's extensive [tutorials](http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/). For photography there's [this free book on DSLR Cinematography](http://nofilmschool.com/dslr/), while videographers can choose between [this ebook (PDF) by Adam Westbrook on multimedia production](http://adamwestbrook.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/6x6-advice-for-multimedia-journalists.pdf) and ImageJunkies's [free ebook on news and documentary filmmaking](http://www.imagejunkies.com/life-behind-the-lens/2011/08/16/lensman-our-new-book-is-ready-for-free-download/).

If you're struggling for a reason to use multimedia, **liveblogging** is a particularly good opportunity to practise your skills: when there's lots going on, what are the multimedia opportunities:

* Do you need to be in position for when something visually or aurally striking happens?

* Or do you need to interview the people taking part, for colour?

* Do you capture the atmosphere somehow?

* Do you map it?

* Do you attempt to flesh out rumours with some actuality?

Every choice counts -- be prepared to make a lot of wrong ones, or at least to accept that part of the journalist's job is deciding what to leave out.

Your first attempts will be crude and frustrating -- but they will point you to the key issues, and provide the motivation for learning the techniques.

For example, your video may have poor audio, or be too shaky. There may be too much of you in it. Your map may have too little information. Your audio drones on for too long, then sputters out.

Largely this is about **planning**: checking out the location and picking a place where background audio isn't too loud. Briefing the interviewee and getting in close. Researching your subject and knowing the right questions to ask -- and when not to accept an answer.

So practise. Learn how to edit your work, just as you would edit your words. Learn how to film closely, or with a microphone, or both to get clearer sound. Learn how to kick off and wrap up audio succinctly. Practise.

## Step 3: Improve the technical side with an understanding of principles

An understanding of key principles is just as important as technical ability: you need to understand what works well in a chosen medium: being able to hold a camera is worthless if you point it at something dull. Being able to edit audio isn't going to help if you don't ask the right questions in the interview. As countless examples of citizen journalism have proved: people will forgive poor technical quality if the newsworthiness of the content is strong enough. Here are some key principles that come to mind -- I'd welcome others:

* Narrative: how to start, maintain interest, and end well.

* Interviewing: what questions to ask, when and how.

* Editing and composition: how to combine elements for maximum clarity and effect. Being ruthless in taking things out.

* Visual design: how to compose an image for impact, or what is most effective in a chart

Just as the story provides a focus for the development of technical skills, so these core principles should refine those further. In particular, they should help you make choices quickly, including the difficult ones. What to start with and what to end with. When and what to cut away. How to be confident in what you're doing, and push for the right result.

## Step 4: Start simple, and go from there

With those three steps established, there may be a temptation to try something with multiple angles, cuts, sections, or layers. So the final step is to step _back_, and start simple.

Mobile video is a good discipline here: it prevents you from using cutaways and other techniques to disguise your content -- and forces you to focus on core qualities: clear audio, good questions, and an engaging subject. Maps and charts should focus on a few key data points, and link to the rest. A short podcast will develop your production skills much better than a multi-section programme which pulls you in too many different directions. If you're already good at photography, an audio slideshow will stretch you a little further. Master one part, and then build on that.
